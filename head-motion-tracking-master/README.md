Head Motion Detection and Tracking
=============

This project can perform head tracking and virtually press keys based on movement of head in Python using OpenCV.

[Running these codes requires Python and OpenCV]

File Descriptions:

cam_basic.py : Code that displays an image feed from the camera [Python + OpenCV]

basic_facetrack.py: Code that performs face-tracking using the image feed from a camera [Python + OpenCV]

headtrack_Mouse.py: Code that virtually presses arrow keys depending on your face movement.
